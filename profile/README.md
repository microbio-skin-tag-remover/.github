## MicroBio Skin Tag Remover: How does Work!

MicroBio Skin Tag Remover utilizes the power of essential oils for quick and effective skin tag removal. It's simple to use – just apply the serum directly to the skin tag and let it dry. The serum works by increasing blood flow to the area, loosening the cells that hold the skin tag in place. In just a few days, the skin tag will naturally fall off.

There's no need for complicated steps – just apply the serum and let it do its job. Allow about 30 minutes for the serum to dry. If you prefer, you can cover the area with masking tape or regular tape. Then, relax and watch as your skin tag disappears in a matter of days. With consistent use of MicroBio Skin Tag Remover, those annoying skin tags will be gone for good, and you won't have to worry about them coming back!

## MicroBio Skin Tag Remover: How to Apply!

- Clean the Area: Begin by gently washing the area around the skin tag with a mild cleanser, then pat it dry with a clean towel. Cleaning the area ensures the serum can work effectively.
- Apply the Serum: Use the applicator provided or a cotton swab to apply a small amount of MicroBio Skin Tag Remover directly onto the skin tag. Be sure to avoid getting it on the surrounding skin.
